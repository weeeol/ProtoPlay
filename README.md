# ProtoPlay
**ProtoPlay** is a small experimental game project currently in **very early development**, built using the **Pygame** library. The goal of ProtoPlay is to serve as a foundation for testing simple game mechanics, input handling, and sprite movement in Python.

At this stage, ProtoPlay focuses on basic features such as player control, collision detection, and simple visuals. It’s primarily a sandbox environment meant to experiment with Pygame’s core features—rendering, events, and timing—before expanding into a complete gameplay experience.

The project is still in its prototype phase, so most assets, UI elements, and gameplay systems are placeholders. Future updates will include refined graphics, improved controls, and additional mechanics as development progresses.
